# Nexmo APIs Quickstart Examples for ASP .NET MVC (4.6.2)
The purpose of the quickstart guide is to provide simple examples focused on one goal. For example, sending an SMS, handling an incoming SMS webhook or making a Text to Speech call.

# Configure with Your Nexmo Credentials 
To use this sample you will first need a Nexmo account. Once you have your own API credentials, replace API_KEY, API_SECRET, and NEXMO_FROM_NUMBER in 'appsettings.json'

Run the app.

# Request More Examples
Please raise an issue to request an example that isn't present within the quickstart. Pull requests will be gratefully received.
